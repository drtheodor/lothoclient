# GDiscord (Godot Discord)

A Discord client written in Godot, because the performance can't 
get worse than Electron!

## How to use
Set variables via `.env` file or via whatever your OS provides:
- `CHANNELS`: comma-separated list of Discord channel IDs.
- `TOKEN`: your Discord token.

## TODO
- Replace circle avatar shader with something less CPU-intensive.
- Everything else.
